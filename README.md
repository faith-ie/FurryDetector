**Disclaimer** : I have absolutely nothing against furries, I just made this package because it was super simple and easy to do lol

**Example on how to use this package** : 

```cs
using FurryDetector;
using System;

namespace PackageExample
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main() => Console.WriteLine(Detect.IsAFurry(Console.ReadLine()));  // Returns "True" if the input contains owo or uwu, and "False" if it doesn't. 
    }
}
```
